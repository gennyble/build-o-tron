// HELLO READER, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND SQL WELL ENOUGH, THIS MAY NOT WORK CORRECTLY!
// the intent of this query is to select one run per host that has run a job. which makes for an
// important question: which run should be representative of runs on a host? my somewhat arbitrary
// choice is "the most recent". this seems like a least-bad option: if a job has been re-run and is
// in progress, that in-progress one ought to be at least indicated. if the job has been re-run and
// that later run is complete, it is either substantially simpler to a previous run (since it would
// have the same commit, same goodfile, etc), or reflects the most recent intent of the CI runner
// environment (did a runner bug get fixed? flake of network, disk, something else being retried?).
// if it does *not* reflect the most recent intent, whatever is wrong can be fixed and retried
// again.
//
// so, do not consider the state of a job: the most recent one is the one to be shown. if data is
// present for a previous run and should be shown in a "imminently replaced" capacity, that's a
// problem for future me.
//
// ok, now with all that said, this once upon a time relied on a sqlite quirk allowing
// non-aggregate expressions that do not appear in the query's `group by`. sqlite even happened to do the thing i want in that circumstance - the query looked something like:
//  ```
//  select max(id), job_id, host_id, completed_time from runs where job_id=?1 group_by host_id;
//  ```
//  where `max(id)` collapses the group to one of the rows with max `id`. since `id` is distinct
//  this happens to collapse the group to one row, which as the desired fields for each subsequent
//  expression in the `select`.
//
//  this query is simply not allowed in many other database engines (exception MySQL). it was too
//  difficult to figure out why this works right (or if this is subtly wrong), so i've changed the
//  query this more portable form that is more obviously correct: only select aggregations or
//  non-aggregations that are part of `group by`. so only select `id` and `host_id`, subsequent
//  fields for each row have to be selected later on-demand.
